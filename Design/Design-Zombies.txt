Zombies Design - Zombies

Zombies come in waves. But in each wave come more and more zombies, and they are stronger too.

Defense (Capability to resist attacks. Hearts that are not affected per each attack received; example: Received 5 Attack, but the zombie has 3 defense. 5 - 3 = 2, then the zombie will lose 2 hearts)
Attack (How much damage will be dealt in HPA - Hearts Per Attack)
