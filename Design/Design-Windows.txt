Zombies Design - Windows

Zombies come by Windows.

They take 3 Blocks of space (see Blocks).
Zombies can exit from it, but can't turn back to it neither the Player (see Player).

For a Zombie to exit the Window, he needs to break it.

After a window has breaked, the player can go there and fix it. There are some different Blocks in 
the front of the Windows; if the player stands on top of it, he automatically repairs the window.
