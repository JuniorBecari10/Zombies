Zombies Design - Enchanting

The Enchantment Table stays at Garden, and costs 1000 gold to enchant a weapon.

An Enchanted Weapon has a tag indicating that is Enchanted and it's damage is doubled, and the Use Cooldown stays at half of it.

Example:

Weapon not Enchanted: 10 Attack, 500ms Cooldown
Same Weapon Enchanted: 20 Attack, 250ms Cooldown
